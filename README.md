# Visual Analysis of Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Japan

## Description:

This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan over the past 100 years (1925-2024). 
It features various data visualizations highlighting the frequency, magnitude, and impacts of these natural disasters, sourced from the NOAA Hazards database. 
The visualizations aim to offer valuable insights into the patterns and effects of earthquakes and tsunamis, helping researchers, policymakers, and the general public to better understand and prepare for these events.
